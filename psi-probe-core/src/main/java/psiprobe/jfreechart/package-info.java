/**
 * Jfreechart dropped simulated 3D support in 1.5.0. Per authors of Jfreechart
 *
 * "All the classes relating to pseudo-3D charts have been removed, as much better 3D charts are
 * offered by Orson Charts so we prefer not to maintain the pseudo-3D chart code within JFreeChart"
 *
 * See https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart for more information.
 *
 * For continued support of psi-probe and to remain on supported software, it was decided to port
 * this code here. This is for internal usage only and eventually psi-probe should follows 'authors'
 * advice for support.
